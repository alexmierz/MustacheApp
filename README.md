  <p align="center">
    This app allows you to try three different types of mustaches on your face along with the ability to record yourself with or without audio sound. Then you can either save the video to your camera roll or retake a video. Future implementations will be fixing the on board video library screen to allow the user to view all recorded videos within the app.
